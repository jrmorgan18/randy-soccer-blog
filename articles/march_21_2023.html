<p class="c1"><span class="c4 c6">European Soccer Recap 3/21/23</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This week the competition for Europe&rsquo;s biggest prize narrowed down to eight teams as the last four entrants into the Champions League quarterfinals were decided midweek. Over the weekend the German title race continued to provide the most drama of any in Europe, with another flip-flop at the top of the standings. In Spain, the third Clasico of the season between Real Madrid and Barcelona finished with the title race all but over. Up in England the action was split between the Premier League and the FA Cup with Arsenal extending their lead in the former while Manchester City impressed in the latter. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>There weren&rsquo;t many highlights from the Americans abroad, but several played key roles in a relegation battle in England as well as a crazy finish in the FA Cup. </span><span class="c4">Christian Pulisic</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;had a decent outing getting a start for Chelsea and another teenage American debuted in Germany. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Later this week we will have a preview of the upcoming international break for the US men. Interim head coach Anthony Hudson has called in a mix of veterans from the World Cup roster and players looking to breakthrough and earn a more regular spot as the US plays their first two official games since the World Cup. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">European Roundup</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Champions League</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The Champions League whittled down to the final eight teams this week with the remaining four second-leg matches on Tuesday and Wednesday. On Tuesday, Manchester City delivered one of the most dominant beatdowns of the season with a 7-0 win over RB Leipzig. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was a historic night for Erling Haaland, who joined Leo Messi and Luiz Adriano as just the third player ever to score five goals in a Champions League game. The towering striker was in the right place at the right time all night and was ruthless with his finishing, scoring the five goals on just eight shots. He opened the scoring with a penalty kick in the 22nd minute and City was off to the races from there. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The other matchup on Tuesday had considerably less fireworks, as Porto and Inter Milan played to a scoreless stalemate that saw Inter Milan advance 1-0 on aggregate. The game was as dull as the scoreline for most of the night, however it did provide some late drama. Porto poured on the pressure in the closing minutes, needing a goal to keep the game alive. They came ever so close to finding the goal they needed, with two certain goals cleared off the line by defenders and another shot off the post in injury time. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Wednesday&rsquo;s games brought less drama as Real Madrid and Napoli both entered with formidable leads against Liverpool and Eintracht Frankfurt. Both teams took care of business to cruise into the next round. Napoli continued to steamroll all comers, riding a two goal effort from Victor Osimhen en route to a 3-0 win to advance 5-0 on aggregate. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The game in Madrid was a little more balanced, providing an entertaining back and forth matchup despite the low scoreline. Each keeper came up with several big saves to keep the game scoreless in the first half. Liverpool increasingly pressed harder in the second half needing to overcome the huge deficit from the first leg and eventually Madrid took advantage. The defending champions got a goal from Karim Benzema, set up by a scrappy effort from Vinicius Jr. to seal their place in the quarterfinals. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The draw for the final rounds took place on Friday, resulting in some tantalizing quarterfinal matchups. The top billed pairing will pit the two betting favorites against each other, with Manchester City and Bayern Munich drawn together. The past two Champions League winners, Real Madrid and Chelsea, will square off to see who meets the City-Bayern winner in the semis. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The other side of the bracket has a strong Italian flavor, with runaway Serie A leaders Napoli drawn against the reigning Serie A champs, AC Milan. That winner will face the winner of Portuguese dark horse, Benfica, and Inter Milan. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Given the quarterfinal pairings and the way the bracket sets up, Napoli look to have the best path to the trophy. Despite Manchester City&rsquo;s recent offensive fireworks, Napoli has been the best team in Europe, with strength on both sides of the ball, and they get to avoid the other three top favorites left in the competition until the final. Even though their price was much better a few weeks ago, they remain a pretty good betting bargain at around +350.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">England</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In the Premier League, Arsenal extended their lead at the top of the table with a comfortable 4-1 win over Crystal Palace, led by two goals and an assist from winger Bukayo Saka. With Manchester City off from league play, the win pushed their lead to eight points. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Down towards the bottom of the table, the Americans at Leeds had a crucial showdown with fellow relegation battler, Wolverhampton. Leeds came away with an important 4-2 win that temporarily jumps them up to 14th in the standings and two points above the relegation line. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Brenden Aaronson </span><span>and </span><span class="c4">Weston McKennie</span><span>&nbsp;started for Leeds, with </span><span class="c4">Tyler Adams</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;missing out with an injury. Both Americans had solid outings with McKennie providing a strong box to box presence and coming up with several timely defensive interventions around his own box. Aaronson had some ups and downs, delivering a nice cutback pass that set up a great look at goal but also scuffing a great look himself just before being subbed off late in the game. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The other big games of the weekend in England came in the FA Cup quarterfinals. Man City rode the hot hand from their seven goal outburst in the Champions League to drop another six goals on second division leaders Burnley in a 6-0 rout. Erling Haaland capped off a historic week with a hat-trick in the game, giving him eight goals on the week. Kevin De Bruyne chipped in with two assists and Julian Alvarez got two goals and provided one assist. City will meet another second division team, Sheffield United, in the semifinals.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">On the other side of the bracket, Manchester United escaped with a 3-1 win over Fulham in a game that was tight until a crazy final fifteen minutes. Fulham played United well, carrying a 1-0 lead late into the second half until it all unraveled in one sequence. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Manchester United got a quick counterattack that finished with a Jadon Sancho shot being blocked by Fulham&rsquo;s Willian with a handball on the goalline. The handball resulted in a straight red card and a penalty that United converted. To make matters worse, Fulham striker Aleksander Mitrovic also got a red card for bumping the ref while arguing the call, reducing Fulham to nine men for the rest of the game. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>The advantage proved too much as United tacked on two more goals in quick succession and advanced with a 3-1 win. Both </span><span class="c4">Tim Ream</span><span>&nbsp;and </span><span class="c4">Antonee Robinson </span><span class="c0">started and played well for Fulham before the game fell apart. Manchester United moves on to face Brighton in the semis.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Germany</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In the Bundesliga the drama ramped up once again with a shakeup at the top of the standings. On Saturday, Borussia Dortmund blew the doors off Koln with a 6-1 win. Marco Reus and Sebastian Haller each scored a pair of goals and Raphael Guerreiro continued his hot streak with a goal and two assists. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The win proved especially important when Bayern Munich were upset on the road against Bayer Leverkusen on Sunday. After going behind on a Joshua Kimmich goal in the 22nd minute, Leverkusen bounced back with two second half goals off penalties and held out for a 2-1 win. The result left Dortmund in sole possession of first place, one point ahead of Bayern.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Elsewhere in the league, 19 year old American attacker </span><span class="c4">Paxten Aaronson</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;(brother of Brenden) made his debut for Eintracht Frankfurt. Aaronson subbed on in the 82nd minute of their 2-0 loss to Union Berlin. Though he didn&rsquo;t have much involvement in the waning minutes, it was a big moment for the teenager, who could be a key player for the US Under-20 team at their World Cup this summer. </span></p><p class="c1 c3 c7"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Spain</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The third Real Madrid vs Barcelona Clasico of the season ended with the La Liga title all but wrapped up. Despite the absence of star midfielder Pedri due to injury, Barcelona managed to pull out a 2-1 comeback victory to extend their lead to a seemingly insurmountable twelve points. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The visiting Real Madrid went up early in this one when a Vinicius Jr. cross took a very fortunate deflection off Ronald Araujo&rsquo;s head and past a powerless Ter Stegen. However, it was Barcelona who had the better of the game from there, playing more proactively than in their recent Copa del Rey win over Madrid. The Catalans took the game to their opponent with the home crowd behind them, keeping the pressure in the Madrid end. They finally evened the score just before halftime when Sergi Roberto struck home a loose ball in the box. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">With a draw suiting Barcelona well given their comfortable lead in the table, Real Madrid began pushing higher and higher in attack, trying to find a winner. They seemed to do just that in the 81st minute when a Carvajal ball found Marco Asensio in the box and he slotted it home, however, Asensio was ruled offside by VAR and the goal was wiped off. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In injury time, Barcelona caught Madrid with numbers forward and launched a counterattack that found Alex Balde free down the left side. The young fullback picked out a precise pass to find Franck Kessie arriving in the box and directing it past Thibaut Courtois to seal the 2-1 victory. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Italy</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In Serie A, Napoli extended their lead to 19 points with a 4-0 thrashing of Torino. Like clockwork, Victor Osimhen and Kvaradona led the way. Osimhen added two more goals to his league leading tally and Kvaradona scored a goal and assisted another.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Below them, Lazio got a tight 1-0 win over crosstown rivals Roma in the derby of the Italian capital. The win pushed Lazio up to second place while Inter Milan dropped behind them into third after losing 1-0 to a red hot Juventus team. Had it not been for the docked points due to financial misdeeds, Juventus may just be pushing Napoli for the title. Instead they find themselves seven points back of the Champions League places. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">France</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">With most of the drama gone from the Ligue 1 title race, Paris St. Germain produced a listless effort and were upset 2-0 by Rennes. Despite the loss they remain seven points clear at the top of the standings. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Team of the Week</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">G: Onana - Inter Milan</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">D: Zaccagni - Lazio; Kim - Napoli; Dias - Man City; Guerreiro - Dortmund</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">M: De Bruyne - Man City; de Jong - Barcelona; Reus - Dortmund</span></p><p class="c1"><span>F: Saka - Arsenal; Haaland - Man City; Osimhen - Napoli</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Player of the Week</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Erling Haaland - Manchester City</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">WIth AI and GPT-4 all over the headlines, we may need to check if Haaland isn&rsquo;t actually a cyborg created to score goals. The 22 year old Norwegian found the net an incredible EIGHT times this week between the Champions League and FA Cup. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">What he is doing in his first season with Manchester City is truly unprecedented in the modern era. Haaland now has 42 goals in 37 games across all competitions this season. This week he became just the sixth Premier League player to ever eclipse the 40 goal mark across all competitions in a single campaign, with upwards of fourteen games still remaining for City. Mo Salah and Ruud Van Nistelrooy share the record for most goals across competitions for a Premier League player at 44, just two more than Haaland&rsquo;s current tally. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The European record for goals across all competitions is Messi&rsquo;s 73 in the 2011-12 season. That record seems fairly untouchable, but if Haaland continues to put up eight-goal weeks, he could just start to threaten it down the stretch.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
